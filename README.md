# Bluetooth-Controlled-Mobile-Robot-with-Autonomous-Navigation
The project focuses on the development of a Bluetooth-controlled mobile robot capable of operating in both manual and autonomous modes. It integrates multiple control mechanisms with real-time radar visualization for enhanced functionality and user interaction.

Key Features:
Dual Operating Modes:
Manual Mode: Control the robot using gesture control, keyboard inputs, or voice commands via Bluetooth communication.
Autonomous Mode: Implemented obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.

Radar Visualization: Displays real-time mapping of obstacles on a connected laptop using Processing or Python.
Bluetooth Communication: Enables seamless wireless control and data transmission.

Hardware Components:
Arduino Mega
Motor Driver
Bluetooth Module
Ultrasonic Sensors
Servomotors
4 Geared Motors with Tires
